# Computer-Vision-project
Performed mean shift segmentation of given color images which may be corrupted by noise.

- The project deals with performing mean shift segmentation of an image which may have noise.
- Traversed each pixel of the filtered image and then plotted them appropriately on a feature space or a grid and applied the mean shift segmentation routine on the data values plotted on the feature space and shifting the mean values towards the dense regions.
- Retraced the image from the plotted dense points on the feature space.
